                        My newest and favorite hobby is crochet. In December of 2021 I decided that I wanted to crochet
                        a pair of leg warmers for my aunt for the holidays. I picked up this hobby and fell in love. It
                        has been a blast learning how to crochet and all that comes with it. I’m now obsessed with
                        buying yarn and working it up into bags, sweaters, scarfs, washcloths, shawls and anything else
                        I can come up with. It is very relaxing and by the end of a project, I have something awesome to
                        show off. This is a picture of something I am currently working on.

                        I love to hang out with my dogs. One hobby of mine is being a dog mom. I love taking them out to
                        explore the world and curling up on the couch with them. I have two dogs. I rescued an
                        Australian Shepheard last year. His name is Chance and is about two years old. Then I have
                        Calliope. She is a six-year-old Alaskan Klee Kai. I like to say one of my hobbies is just
                        watching them sleep because they are so cute!

                        In most of my spare time, I play video games with my friends. This is one of my longest standing
                        hobbies as it is my way to socialize. This was really the case during the pandemic. The only
                        social interaction I had was with my friends was through gaming. This is actually how I met my
                        partner ten years ago. My favorite game is Hunt: Showdown.

                        My first actual job was working at a kid’s clothing store. I did that for about a year and then
                        started working at a kid’s after-school tutoring center. At the time I thought I wanted to be a
                        teacher. I ran this center from ages 17 – 22. It was great. From there, I moved to a different
                        state and started working at a college. I loved working around the college. I held many
                        positions, moving from a temporary position to a full-time employee. However, after a year
                        there, I moved to Bellevue Nebraska and started working at the University. Here, I worked as a
                        Financial Aid Specialist for about five or six years.

                        I still work at Bellevue University in the Financial Aid Department. However, I have migrated to
                        working on the Analyst team. For the last year, we have been migrating systems from one
                        financial aid system to another. It has been a lot of fun learning about some of the backend
                        work that affects my department. Additionally, I have started working a lot closer with our tech
                        teams which is one of the reasons why I decided to go into software development. In fact, the
                        weeks we were focusing on SQL and databases, was the same time that I had to apply that
                        knowledge to my job and it was very cool!

                        I’m not sure what I want to do in the future. I have never really had a plan for what I wanted
                        to do when I grow up. Currently, I would like to work my way onto the tech teams here at
                        Bellevue. I like working for the University and would like to continue in tech as I am having so
                        much fun learning all this material. I want to be able to apply that to the future. However, my
                        dream would be to make a full-time living off selling my crafter goods. I know this is
                        unrealistic and I’ll probably do that as a side gig. For now, I’m just focusing on graduating.
